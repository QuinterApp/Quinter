Adds alt S to open the user menu (Thanks Alex Hall for suggesting!)
The readme has been completely rewritten. It's still missing some information, but you'll have to let us know what you think.
Separates out audio playback into external media player called QPlay. This means quite a few things, quicker load times, less RAM usage, etc. Note: You may have to set your external media player (now called media player) to QPlay manually if you want to use it. Playback functionality directly in the client has been removed.

0.59
Fixes list manager unable to properly load with no lists.
If your account API call number could produce false positives, you're now alerted.

Emergency fix for sounds not working on some clients.

0.56
We now show the bio in user lists.
You can now press control semicolon or command semicolon on mac for speak user summary in user viewer/profile dialogs!
We can now stream user timelines. This is very dependant on a few factors, so it may not stream all the time if at all, but it does when it can. If you load a user timeline for a user you don't follow and wish for it to stream, you will need to restart the program.
Fixed some bugs on direct message receive with remove emojis enabled which in worst cases could cause timeline refreshing to halt.
Fixes (hopefully) some links not appearing correctly in streamed tweets.
Some modifications to the user cache to hopefully majorly reduce lag with switching between buffers.
Replaces clean user database option with refresh user database, which cleans the entire database rather than checking for duplicate users. It is recommended to restart after performing this clean, and not to perform it unless you notice lag.

0.55
Fixes quoted tweets with the streaming API... Properly this time.
On Mac OS, native spell checking support is now enabled for the tweet text field. Press command semi or command shift semi for a dialog. Thanks Sarah A for letting us know that this didn't work before!

Fixes mac and streaming support.

0.53
Adds an option to remove emojis and other unicode text from tweet text.
SAPI is fixed.
Starts work on streaming support for Quinter. This is not very obvious to find because it's very unstable, and retweets and quote tweets don't always parse correctly, but it's there if you choose to use it. This only works so far on home, mentions, sent, and *some* list timelines.

0.52
Switches to another speech output method on Windows. This should fix JAWS.
We now have quoted and retweeted templates.
We now show if a user is protected and their URL in the user viewer.
You can now remove emojis and other unicode characters from user display names. This is experimental.

0.51
Puts a limit on how many user timelines and list timelines can be open at a time (8 per each). This was the cause of the problem with the sent timeline failing to update, the user timeline endpoint was being spammed majorly by our client due to way too many user timelines being opened at a time, so we needed to put a limit on this. Sorry for the inconvenience this may cause, and please consider using a list if you would like to see tweets from a large amount of users at once.
We now ignore the API 429 error when pulling timelines. We still send it to the view API errors option in the help menu, so you can still see if it happens, we just don't speak and play a sound if it does. Other errors like rate limit exceeded will still play.
You can no longer open multiple copies of a user or list timeline.

0.5

Fixes System Access (Thanks Jeffrey Stark for reporting! Let us know if it works!)
Adds an option in advanced to disable speaking of position information in invisible interface.
Adds an option to make an earcon play whenever you are not at the top (or bottom if reversed) of a timeline, which may mean you have new items.

0.49
Fixes new tweet and a couple others in menu to say the correct shortcut.
Reassigns autoread and mute to alt+win+shift+e and M in invisible interface.
Adds user search (Not working yet)!
Fixes invisible interface not playing the earcons for audio and video tweets.

0.48
You can now mute/unmute the sounds on a timeline-specific basis.
You can now have specific timelines automatically read tweets as they come in.
The shortcuts are now stated on the menu items. For example, Accounts (control+A).
We no longer tell the keys for the UI in the readme, as they can be found in the menu options themselves.
We now use methods suggested by Tyler Spivey to hopefully make accessing the UI more responsive. I don't notice a difference personally, but someone might?

0.47
Changes name of remove button in remove user from list dialog. It was labeled "Add" before.
Adds autocomplete user to new tweet dialog!
Fixes a bad bug where if you have syncing of the interfaces off, you couldn't destroy more than one conversation/timeline.

0.46
There is now an option in the advanced options on Windows to force the invisible interface not to sync with the UI, thus reducing lag by a lot.
Fixes a bug with custom soundpacks causing some sounds not to play if they don't exist.
We no longer pull reply usernames from the tweet text, and instead do what you're supposed to do and use the user_mentions entity array. This fixes many problems the mention system had.
You can now press control shift O to open twitter in your web browser directly to the focused tweet.
Thread mode now has an access Key (Thanks NS for notifying about it)
The new tweet/reply/quote/message dialog has been redesigned from the ground up to be more twitter like. Replies no longer take up characters in your tweets, you can easily remove users from threads, and more!
The recipient edit field in the direct message dialog is no longer a multi line edit field.
Sending direct messages should no longer fail as often.

0.45
Emergency patch: Fixed a really bad bug resulting from user timeline sounds causing errors if you had ran Quinter after 0.4.

0.44
Added a sent tweets buffer.
Resized the text fields a bit, hopefully fixing visuals, and making word wrap a lot better.
If you type an @ symbol before someone's username, it still brings up the profile.

Added a new global key (control+windows+alt+a) to speak the current account.
You are now alerted if trying to view a tweet that has been deleted (thanks Wren)!

We no longer speak 1 of 0 on empty timelines in the invisible interface.
Quoted tweets should always expand now.

0.41
The window title now shows which account you are in.
Regular tweets will send out as proper tweets now. They were doing this before, but Quinter wasn't realizing what it was sending were actually tweets, and it was trying to attach a blank tweet ID to the tweet when it didn't need to. This wasn't hurting anything, it was just something I noticed just now so I fixed it.
Adds the windows alt space key in the invisible interface keymap to speak the currently focused item.
Generalizes some control names.
Adds an account options dialog, where you can set independant account soundpacks and tweet footers.
Fixes reverse timelines.

0.4
Fixed previous and next in thread in reversed timelines.
Fixed retweeting in the view tweet dialog.
We now support multiple accounts! See the application menu. Yet another small change log entry for such a massive pain, as well as massive feature, but eh.
Remapped the list hotkeys in the GUI to account for the account manager hotkeys.

0.36
Adds a prompt asking if you want to follow @QuinterApp. You only get prompted for this one time upon login.

You can now view recent API errors by opening View API errors in the help menu.
You can now reverse timelines. Such a small changelog entry for such a huge pain in the butt, but that's how it goes sometimes, rofl!

0.35
When you hit yes to download an update, the program now exits after opening the browser.
If you do not enter a pin, the program will now exit rather than trying to authorize anyway, causing big problems.
We now have sounds for when a tweet contains audio playable by the client as well as audio playable by the external media player only.
If you are unable to message a user, you are now told this instead of the dialog just continuing to sit there.

0.33
If a sound doesn't exist in the current soundpack, Quinter no longer throws an error when trying to play it. Instead, it will just play the sound from the default soundpack.
Removed raw symbols such as &amp; you now see the propper symbol.

Fixed searches not destroying from your config when you closed them.
Sounds are now loaded from the config dir.
